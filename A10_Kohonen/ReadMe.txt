Training neurons

iteration 50 : changing radius from 4 to 3
iteration 250 : changing radius from 3 to 2
iteration 500 : changing radius from 2 to 1
Converged : 1000 iteration

Testing neurons

X1 = [0.1, 0.8].T
X2 = [0.5, -0.2].T
X3 = [-0.8, -0.9].T
X4 = [-0.6, 0.9].T

After Testing the neurons with input data :

Neuron 95 responds to the input vector X1 i.e., n1 = [0.15, 0.80]
Neuron 33 responds to the input vector X2 i.e., n2 = [0.46, -0.28]
Neuron 10 responds to the input vector X3 i.e., n3 = [-0.84, -0.80]
Neuron 98 responds to the input vector X4 i.e., n4 = [-0.48, 0.89]
